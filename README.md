# Childhood-Vaccination

With the help of this platform, vaccinations and examinations will become much easier for doctors. During the first year of life the child consistently receives about 10 vaccinations, there are also monthly tests and examinations from a pediatrician and other specialists. A personal id will be assigned for each child, which is also tied to the mother's data, so that mother’s and child’s data can be synchronized to predict the probability of a diseases based on mother’s symptoms.

Before each vaccination a notification and an invitation for a specific date with a ticket is sent to the mobile application. 
The district doctors will not have to go through the sectors and ring up everyone. In this way, we release nurses from routine tasks. And the mother sees the vaccination table in advance and gets acquainted with the guidance on preparation for vaccination, and after the vaccination she receives a message on how to take care of the child properly during these 2-3 days after the vaccine.

If a child is diagnosed with any disease, the prescriptions of doctors will not be forgotten somewhere on the table. The nurse immediately writes this all to the database. The nurse also establishes a notification for the treatment of the child, that is, for taking medications and certain procedures. Risks that the child is not up to receive the dose of certain medicated pills decreases.

Also, there will be no need for endless hooters or occupied lines in polyclinics, since a ticket to the doctor can be obtained online. This is especially important for morning blood and urine tests. Children won’t wait in the queue, the mother shows the ticket number in the form of a combination of numbers and letters or QR-code.
